# Streamkit

Streamkit is an open-source alternative to StreamElementsâ„¢, made specifically with Indian streamers in mind.

If you stream, you probably know StreamElementsâ„¢â€”it's what most creators use for overlays, sponsorship cards, and accepting donations without getting hit with fees. It's way better than YouTube Superchat or Twitch Hypechat, which take a huge 30-40% cut from every donation.

But here's the problem: StreamElementsâ„¢ only works with Cards and PayPal. Most Indian viewers don't use thoseâ€”they use UPI or their regular debit/credit cards.

That's exactly why I built Streamkit. It lets Indian streamers accept donations via UPI with zero\* commission, while giving you all the customization and features you'd expect from something like StreamElementsâ„¢.

ðŸŒŸ What You Get

**Donation System**  
Accept donations in rupees through UPI or Cashfree. No more dealing with PayPal or other foreign payment systems that don't work well in India.

**TTS Donations via AI Characters API**  
Let your viewers send Text-to-Speech messages with custom AI voices. It keeps the stream entertaining and gives people a fun way to interact.

**Remote OBS Control for Moderators**  
This one's pretty rareâ€”your mods can actually control OBS remotely. They can switch scenes, add or remove sources, and help you run the stream without you having to juggle everything yourself.

**Alerts & Overlay System**  
Fully customizable alerts and overlays so you can make everything match your vibe. Essential for any decent stream setup.

**Sponsorship Alerts**  
Something you won't find elsewhereâ€”display sponsor alerts on your stream to help land brand deals and monetize beyond just donations.

**Revenue Dashboard**  
See exactly what you're earning with a clean dashboard. Track payouts, check who your top supporters are, see how often people donate, and get insights into average donation amounts.

**Media Share Donations**  
Viewers can pay to play videos, clips, or memes on your stream. It's interactive, hilarious, and keeps people engaged.
